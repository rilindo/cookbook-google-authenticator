google-authenticator Cookbook
=============================
Installs google-authenticator and updated pam to support use it. The following recipes are included:

* google-authenticator::sshd
    - configures sshd to support google-authenticator

Requirements
------------
This has been tested and locked on Fedora 19. Future support will be added for other distributions.

For testing and code contribution, use FoodCritic and ChefSpec.

Attributes
----------
* `['google-authenticator']['package_name']` - name of google package authentication package. Defaults to `google-authenticator`
* `['google-authenticator']['sshd_pamd']` - location of sshd pam module. Defaults to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`
* `['google-authenticator']['nullok']` - allow the `nullok` value? Defaults to null value. [Read more](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam#nullok)


Installation
------------

You can download directly using the knife cookbook tool. If you want to get the latest version:

1. Create a directory called `google-authenticator` in your cookbook directory
2. cd to that directory
3. clone from the repo with: `git git@github.com:rilindo/cookbook-google-authenticator.git .`

Usage
-----

To install just the package package:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[google-authenticator]",
  ]
}
```

To update sshd to support google-authenticator, in your node's `run_list`, include the sshd recipe along with opscode's openssh:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[google-authenticator]",
    "recipe[google-authenticator::sshd]",
    "recipe[openssh]"
  ]
}
```

Then override the server attribute for openssh with:

```json
{
	"server":{
		"ChallengeResponseAuthentication":"yes"
	}
}
```

(in a future update, this may be added as an explicit attribute change)

You may also override ['google-authenticator']['sshd_pamd'] attribute if the location is different.

Note that this cookbook makes a changes on the pam file through the use of Chef::Util::FileEdit:insert_line_if_no_match(). If you are running a version of Chef client earlier than 10.16.x, this cookbook may not work.
